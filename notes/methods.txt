Count matrices output by vendor pipelines were imported into R. Ambient RNA contamination was estimated using SoupX [1], but count matrices were not adjusted. 
The original count matrices were imported into Seurat V5 [2]. 
QC metrics (unique molecule count, feature count, ribosomal read fraction, mitochondrial read fraction) were added via Seurat.
Doublet detection was performed prior to cell filtering using scDblFinder [3].
Each sample was then filtered with loose global thresholds refelcting normal experimental procedures intended to eliminate low quality cells. 
Cells with greater than 30000 unique transcripts, greater than 10000 unique genes, greater than 15% mitochondrial reads, or greater than 50% ribosomal reads were removed. 
Cells with less than 1000 unique transcripts or less than 200 unique genes were removed. 

[TODO] Gene filtering?
