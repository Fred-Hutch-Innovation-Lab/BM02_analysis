Count matrices output by vendor pipelines were imported into R. Ambient RNA contamination was estimated using SoupX [1], but count matrices were not adjusted. 
The original count matrices were imported into Seurat V5 [2]. 
QC metrics (unique molecule count, feature count, ribosomal read fraction, mitochondrial read fraction) were added via Seurat.
Doublet detection was performed prior to cell filtering using scDblFinder [3].
Each sample was then filtered with loose global thresholds refelcting normal experimental procedures intended to eliminate low quality cells. 
Cells with greater than 30000 unique transcripts, greater than 10000 unique genes, greater than 15% mitochondrial reads, or greater than 50% ribosomal reads were removed. 
Cells with less than 1000 unique transcripts or less than 200 unique genes were removed. 

Processed data was merged at the kit level. Variable features were identified at the kit level using Seurat's 
FindVariableFeatures. Genes with patterns matching B-cell receptor, T-cell receptor, Ig constant, mitochondrial, and ribosomal gene symbols were excluded from variable features to minimize signal caused by invididual differences in the
merged dataset and identify shared clusters across samples. Each kit's final variable feature list had 2000 genes.

Filtered variable feature lists were used to perform principal component analysis using Seurat's RunPCA. The first 20
PCs were used to build a shared nearest neighbor graphs. The SNNs were passed to the Leiden algorithm implemented by iGraph to perform unsupervised clustering on each kit [citation needed].
Resolutions were selected to force 30 clusters, with singletons (cells in a cluster by themselves) collapsed to their nearest cluster using the Seurat approach. 

Cells were annotated on a per-cell basis using SingleR [] using several bulk-RNA reference datasets 
[Mabbott et al. 2013][Novershtern et al. 2011][Monaco et al. 2019]
Cells were also annotated using Seuratâ€™s reference integration method with the dataset from [Stoeckius et al. 2017].

Clusters were then labelled by manually reviewing the majority annotations across the reference dataset mappings
and confirming the calls using cannonnical marker genes pulled from literature reviews and queried and confirmed
in the cellxgene database []. These cluster level labels are used as the final cell-type labels.

UMAPs were generated using the SNN with Seurat's RunUMAP function with default arguments. 

[TODO] Gene filtering?
