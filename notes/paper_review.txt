Reviewing doublet detection and QC filtering thresholds in reference papers
 QC filtering thresholds?	Doublets?
2016_Power analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments.pdf	NA	NA
2017_Compararison sc-main.pdf	Some new method looking at correlation of all cells, removing outliers	> 2x mean UMI per sample (outlier method)
