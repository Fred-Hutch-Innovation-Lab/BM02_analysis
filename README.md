R Analyses for single-cell benchmarking

Counts matrices generation scripts are in the data_generation folder. The main workflow is in the processing_scripts directory. The notebooks are arranged in order for processing & analyzing the data. Figures for publication are generated using the figures/figure_scripts code

On 25-06-06, we discovered a note that for the TCR Benchmark study, samples F4 and F5 had been swapped during a wet-lab step. This affected all data and kits for the TCR benchmark. This swap did not affect the kit-level summary statistics or conclusions drawn from them, but we updated all the code, data, and records to have the correct association.
